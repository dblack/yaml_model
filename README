YamlModel -- an experimental YAML-based OYM for Rails 3.

YamlModel is an experiment bed for me to learn more about ActiveModel and O*M
plugging in Rails 3. It uses ActiveModel, and it implements basic CRUD
operations. 

Install this git repo as a plugin. Then, if you create a model like this:

  class Person < YamlModel
    attr_accessor :name
    validates_presence_of :name
  end

then when you start doing stuff it will create a file in db/ called people.yml,
and you'll be able to do things like:

Loading development environment (Rails 3.0.pre)
>> person = Person.new
=> #<Person:0x2230148 @new_record=true>
>> person.save
=> false
>> person.errors
=> {:name=>["can't be blank"]}
>> person.name = "David"
=> "David"
>> person.save
=> true
>> person.update_attributes(:name => "David Black")
=> true
>> n = person.id
=> 2
>> person = nil
=> nil
>> person = Person.find(n)
=> #<Person:0x220af4c @new_record=false, @errors={}, @name="David Black", @id=2>
>> person.name
=> "David Black"


Also, in your controller you can do the usual create, update_attributes, new,
and save. 

It's very brute-force, in the sense that it keeps reading the whole YAML file
in... not sure how to optimize that away, but I'm not too worried about it right
now. I mainly want the experience of getting the API in place.
